# Hello, visitor ðŸ‘‹ <h1>

I'm graduated in **Business Administration** and currently studying **Systems Analysis and Development**. I like to study and solve logic problems using preferably the C# language (.NET). In my front-end studies, Iâ€™m studying JavaScript with HTML5 and CSS3. In addition, I have notions of SQL using MySQL and SQL Server.
I also have completed some projects with POWER BI using DAX functions.
